//HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

//Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  to.
//Any less than  is a failing grade.
//Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

//If the difference between the and the next multiple of  is less than, round up to the next multiple of.
//If the value of  is less than, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
//For example, will be rounded to  but will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than .


//Given the initial value of  for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process. For each , round it according to the rules above and print the result on a new line.


//Input Format


//The first line contains a single integer denoting  (the number of students). 
//Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer, , denoting student 's grade.

//Constraints

//Output Format

//For each of the grades, print the rounded grade on a new line.

//Sample Input 0

//4
//73
//67
//38
//33
//Sample Output 0

//75
//67
//40
//33

//Student  received a, and the next multiple of  from  is . Since , the student's grade is rounded to .
//Student received a , and the next multiple of from  is . Since , the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is .
//Student received a , and the next multiple of from  is . Since , the student's grade will be rounded to .
//Student received a grade below , so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is .
